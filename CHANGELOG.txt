CHANGELOG for ACL for Drupal 6

acl HEAD:
  Porting to D6:
    - #231096: Implement hook_nodeapi('delete') and remove orphaned {acl_node} records.
    - Improve acl_node_access_explain().
    - Avoid generating E_NOTICEs.
    - Make [Delete] button work.
    - Fix index conflict.
    - Make the embeddable form work.
    - It's really hook_node_access_explain().
    - Ported to D6 (and inadvertently committed hook_node_access_interpret()).
    - Copied from 5.x-1.5.
